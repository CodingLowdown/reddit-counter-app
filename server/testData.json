Fiber optics based internet is the real shit; unless of course you think Elon will eat this lunch.\n\n3. After Covid-19 thingy ends at the end of 2021, it’s mobile related revenue will increase. Plus, 5g will slightly help(that's what others are saying).\n\n4. It’s not ATH. Leaps and shares are not really that expensive. One can sell CC, after getting shares, not a terrible investment in any sense. Plus, F are not bad for this company; one could even argue that they are great, though it is not upon oneself to utter the F word.\n\n5. Warner Media related losses will probably decline pretty quickly.\n\n6. Their debt load is declining and would probably decline more in the coming years and quarters. Especially, expensive debt is declining.\nOne could argue that their debt is unsustainable, but then you would also have to say TSLA's debt load is unsustainable.\n\nEveryone and their mother in the S&amp;P 500 is loaded with debt, and if inflation truly comes after the end of 2021, having more debt is good, not bad.\n\n7. Overall, I would say, in T's case, more doom and gloom is being priced in. Its potential is being mispriced.\n\n8. If ever the management decides to not pay dividend any more, the stock would tumble for a bit and then skyrocket to infinity and beyond.\n\n9. DirecTV will be probably sold. Granted it was a complete waste of time to begin with.\n\nReasons not to buy leaps/shares.\n\n1. It’s a dividend paying stock. Which means one can easily calculate the true price of something rather than relying on some fancy FCF predictions which are absolutely retarded.\nThat means, as long as the company pays this huge amount of dividends, the stock would have to remain connected to reality.\n\n2. 5g investments would make it incur more debt.\n\n3. Management expects only 1% growth in 2021. But again, my common sense tells me, when the time comes for pricing in the growth at the end of 2021, it would probably be already too late to enter. Or maybe, I am retarded.\n\n4. There's no short squeeze opportunity in this stock. Short interest is below 2%.\n\n5. Some of its investments and ventures are now kinda like ICE manufacturers' valuations. People are giving even negative valuations in this sphere. I don't know if it’s negative or not, but it probably isn’t much.\n\n*That's all.*\n\nI think, given the bull case and bear case, bull case outweighs the bear cases substantially and the stock has substantial room to run in the future. That's why, I think leaps or shares would be the best to get into this play.","If T dips below 28. Buy shares.","LEAPs and shares are VERY different here. Shares you get the 7% current yield. LEAPs you do not. T is a dividend stock... not the right place to buy a LEAP... the seller keeps all the dividend value and LEAP holder gets price stagnation/deflation","I thought everyone knew that?","🤞 🤷‍♂️","I don't know why the numbering is getting messed up.","The thing with T is that it doesn't give a fuck about anything. I've been in it on both bad news and great news and let me tell you, it *does not fucking move* ever. the biggest swing I saw before finally exiting ~a month ago was something like $1.50, and then it just corrected. Even since the time I sold to now, it's remained the same","Yeah, that is a risk. But my gamble is that, starting at the end of 2021, this will slightly start to change. Plus one can sell covered calls during that time to pay for some leaps.","thought of that, but the premiums are so ass that it wasn't even worth it","Go home, market.

How the fuck is that idiocy possible?","I remember when I was 18","You've gotta remember a lot of new traders and new WSBers have come in in the last few weeks. \n\nFor those who got exposed to trading for the first time w/ GME, its hard to blame them for having a distorted perspective of what constitutes normal price action. \n\nNo surprise to me that we now have a huge chunk of people chasing pumps. Not unlike the bear brigade that shorted every pump from April to September.","Yeah kinda blows my mind. Making 400% gains in a span of 36 hours is not fucking normal,  even in a bull market, when noobs come to that realization is when people learn what profit taking is.","Yeah. Its really sad. Its both disrupting the normal ebb and flow in WSB and really really hurting people. Yeah they should be smarter but how can you blame them when every populist billionaire and every financial news platform is all saying that retail is \"winning the fight against hedge funds\" and then when it goes down its due to \"fraud and cheating\". \n\nRatings are too good for people to put it simply: it was a pump, then it dumped, and now its over.","Yah agreed. It’s definitely fucking shit up. I’ve said this before, I love GME gang, but holy shit the press and media coverage that wsb was getting is actually getting bad at this point.\n\nRn the news is literally blaming us as the perpetrators for the weed dump , it’s fucking insane. And it’s goina eventually get to the point of srs investigation with a sub this big , it’s goina get stupid \n\nGME May have been the worst thing to happen to his sub","The more new people that join, the longer it takes for us to return to the mean. As we're returning to the mean, if more new people join in another media wave, then the time to return to the mean increases. Its easy when there's like 1mill people here and we get 200k new people from r/all - in a week or two, they're all acclimated. \n\nBut when wave after wave joins in increasingly higher volumes, then the ability for the community to remain organized and maintain it's ebb and flow basically drops to 0. For every 1 regular that's used by a new person to guide them in WSB culture, there's now 6-10 new people who are talking just as confidently and matter of factly about the community. Ironic that I have a young account saying this - but only if you use account age as a metric. Most reddit OG's in general rotate accounts. Plus aged accounts for astroturfing botnets are extremely cheap to buy. \n\nSo if account age isn't reliable as a reference point, if confidence isn't reliable isn't reliable as a reference point, and if the culture present today isn't reliable as a reference point, then how does WSB return to normal? \n\nIt doesn't. We have an AMAZING mod team but no one can wrangle a community this big, let alone dictate cultural norms. It's even harder with WSB since its built on ideals of counter-culture. It wasn't long ago that WSB would shut down if there was an article posted about it or if a WSB post got x-posted and upvoted into r/all. \n\nThings have changed, all we can do is help shape it for the better over time. There are satellite communities that retain different phases of WSB's cultural growth for those who are unwilling or unable to help shape the future here. \n\n&gt; GME May have been the worst thing to happen to his sub\n\nI think it may have some really dramatic unforeseen consequences down the line for retail as a whole. Right now farming retail forums/boards is really hurting large communities that share plays. While hedge funds have always sought to disrupt and exploit alpha being posted online, its never been more prevalent, the users have never been so largely grouped while holding both cash and an inability to entertain contrarian perspectives on stocks, and it's never had such large market-wide consequences. \n\nI imagine some form of regulation will be put into place and I believe the SEC will really start coming down on astroturfers, although their ability to quickly investigate those rings may fall flat, which opens the door for regulation to nip it in the bud.","Hey bud, good write up, totally hope it doesn’t get too crazy in terms of sec snooping.\n\nHope we both print in 2021.\n\nGL","[deleted]","Much more stable industry if you invest in the right shit","Nah, got in SNDL at 1.23 and sold at 3.77","Good for you bro. 💎 is for fucking idiots","Cuz it's fun","Can’t wait to see ZOM 💎🙌🚀 so I know when to sell","Facts!","Then buy puts.","#LOAD UP AMD I HAVE 10 0DTE PRINTING 93c 2/12 😟😟🥳🥳","$F - 3/26 11.5c","Oh yea?

Almost $800 in premium. If the stock tanks, I can buy those back cheap and sell some more. If it starts tanking today I’ll probably get some CSPs actually. At this price and with these options premiums, I’m decently comfortable holding a bag if it drops to $17 again ...

That makes sense, but I’d rather not play with fire. Already gotten burned so many times, I’ll take my small wins here and there.","Yea buying calls is a leveraged way to bet on the stock. It’s bullish and it also exponentiates your losses.

If you are trading options it’s kind of hard to do because they settle in one day.  However if you sell stock, use proceeds to buy options and then sell those options same day or next day you can get tagged with one.","That happens when you’re in a cash account and don’t have the cash to cover a security before it settles.","&gt; Free Riding\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freeriding.asp\n\nExample of Freeriding\nSay you decide to sell shares of Boston Scientific (BSX) on Monday. You then use the cash from the sale to buy shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) on Tuesday. You sell those JNJ shares on Wednesday, a full day before your sale of BSX shares settles.\n\nBecause settlement for the BSX transaction did not occur until Thursday (T+1), there was no cash to cover the purchase of JNJ on Tuesday and the sale of those shares on Wednesday. To avoid freeriding, the investor would have had to wait until settlement—Thursday—before offloading the JNJ shares.\n\n Investors who don't fully understand the regulations may inadvertently violate freeriding laws, so it's important to do your research before you begin trading.\nAs this example illustrates, active traders could easily find themselves in violation of freeriding rules if they do not fully understand cash account trading rules. One of the biggest problems with freeriding is that many investors don't know they're doing it or that the possibility of doing something like this is illegal. For this reason, it is important to become familiar with how freeriding works as well as the SEC rules that prohibit the practice.","Pretty sure it's something like this:\n\n-brokerage let's you instant deposit, meaning you have access to the money immediately even though your actual money hasn't transferred yet\n\n-any purchase you make with this instant deposit is using borrowed money, under good faith that your deposit will settle in a few days\n\n-the next day, you sell the position you bought with the borrowed money\n\n-this means you are getting a \"free ride\" on the money you borrowed, for example you could then cancel your transfer meaning you used margin without putting up your money for collateral\n\nThis is pretty important because otherwise you could just instant deposit money you don't actually have, and then use that borrowed money to gamble and potentially lose it all without having the funds to replace","Thanks for the clarification, Merrill Lynch just restricted my account for 90 days due to this. 😑","Just gonna keep accumulating PLTR and BB","Taiwan #1","Is TSLA dead?

You have chip designers, manufacturers, and suppliers.  The best positioned will be the suppliers and the manufacturers.  TSM is the manufacturer everyone knows, but you gotta understand how a chip is made. TSM still  requires supplies for things like chemicals for vapor deposition and photo resist, machines needed for photolithography, etc. Etc.  Target the companies that make machines for manufacturing and the suppliers of materials that TSM needs.  LRCX, AMAT, KLAC are some examples.\n\nMy personal favorite is applied materials, which constantly beats earnings, had a record backlog of orders last quarter, and looks like it'll get even more business with the shortage.  Applied Materials is a key supplier of equipment to TSM. TSM also committed to spending billions of dollars on capital upgrades. Who do you think they'll be buying machines from to address the shortage? Applied materials.  Also, TSM is opening up a new factory in Arizona that'll likely need new capital equipment to get up and running. Applied materials is right next door in CA. \n\nFinally, did you  see the apple news? Apple id partnering with TSM to make oled displays.  Guess who got into the digital screen market and who has products for manufacturing OLED displays?  Applied materials again.  For a while, the foray into digital screens hasn't been a smashing success for AMAT, which some bears nitpicked on, but it's very possible now that the Apple-TSM deal will rub off on Amat because TSM buys a ton of Amat products.\n\n Imagine how bullish the upcoming forward guidance may be for AMAT during the next ER. It could be monstrous due to the shortage and if there are some easter eggs in the display division that may be changing course from a laggard to a highly in demand area, the response from the market may be outstanding.  But just based on last ER from AMAT, I'd expect this upcoming ER to be a smashing success. Hell, we may even get lucky with a raised dividend because they have so much cash.","Interesting...but how is this all not already priced in? It's trading like up 110% since March lows","totally agree with you man, do you think though with the way AMAT has been running up, if it runs up too much going into earnings it might drop a bit for earnings? are you going to be holding through the earnings call?","Oh tesla, honey child, what is you doin?","#PUMP IT","**LOUDERRRR**","Bumble giving me head now after it was pounded yesterday","I will always watch aunt cathie's monthly podcast at this point  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀","NIO APHA BB 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀","TSLA always opens the week green after a red Friday","What's a good subreddit to follow to make actual money?","r/getajobandworkhardatit","Thanks peacock!","Damn!

He’s helping a ton of small businesses though.","His gme play though...","didn't he lose his ass on TLRY though?",null,"GME PARABOLIC MODE -- ENGAGED","Not quite","So basically options are fucking the market right?\n\nStocks moon and crash overnight as a result of gamma squeezes on options. \n\nAt the same time, every stock dumps after earnings no matter how good/bad because of the same gamma pump into earnings and IV crush post earnings. \n\nLike at this point the market is just following the options right?\n\nEdit to expand:\nAre we not the market makers then? We’re buying so many options, taking advantage of significant leverage that we are literally moving markets, by forcing hedging on calls.","no","Correct","Really, almost no to everything you said.","Enlighten me then because I have no idea what I’m talking about and the crowd seems to agree with me.","Options don't necessarily \"fuck\" the market. You can be bearish and bullish with options, on both sides of the strike.\n\nGamma squeezes do not necessarily moon/crash stocks. To say it is because of one metric or formula is incorrect.  \n\n\nEvery stock does not dump after earnings. Earnings consist of a CPA's evaluation of a company at a certain time. Conference calls, also have market outlook and more underlying information. Companies can have better than expected earnings, yet have a bleak outlook and decreased sales- which could drive a stock price down.  \n\n\nMM play in options and not really individual stocks. GME is an example of what happened when stocks did not follow the options. It's a question of what came first, the chicken or the egg.","Yeah but we’re having a more outsized effect. \n\nie, everyone has always played the earnings run up. Speculating on it. But now instead of buying shares, we are buying options. En masse. \n\nWhich then requires hedging. And through our use of leverage, on top of the rest of the earnings momentum speculation, you see price rise into earnings, after which IV crush hits options and people either take gains or losses and close their options. Which then reduces the hedge risk for the call seller, right?  \n\nWhich is why we see the pronounced exit after earnings. Basically it’s the same market mechanics as always, but amplified by the options flow and leverage at work.","You are correct, usually by the time earnings come around, the good news is already priced in.\n\nYou have to remember that most metrics are dependent on independent variables. For example, the greeks and IV are not independent.\n\nYou are also assuming that everyone has the same rules as when to sell/buy. Some people will look to simply take the premium, some will look to buy/sell at a discount. For example, I am happy with taking 30% profit in general. I recently sold 1 cover called on IBM Mar 26 for $2.053. I did a straight single option trade. It currently last traded at $1.61. In two days, I could buy the call and make about $50 profit. Granted the IV is only ~30%. \n\nOn the flip side, I had bought BRKS at $80.57, and it is trading at $91.47 right now. I had also sold CC Mar 19 85 Cover Calls at 3.343. It last traded for $6.91  with bid 8.70/ask9.90. They had earnings the other day and have simply gone up since then. Anyhow, I am fine with letting it get called at $85 where I got my premium and the profit.\n\nIt's difficult to objectively quantify \"sentiment\". So BRKS is an example that stocks can go up after earnings.","Well I guess it would come back to options flow. \n\nIf you can see large numbers of outstanding calls either at or very near the money, about 2 weeks before earnings, you can assume they’ll all move ITM. Which should then cause some light gamma squeezing, hitting further ITM options. Whether it passes it across a big volume threshold is hard to say, but that sure seems to be driving a lot of the pricing. But like I said I don’t really know that much. Just making observations","Each strike has a Probability of being ITM percent as well as implied volume %. It would be impossible for all strikes to be ITM.\n\nI always try to cover myself when I make trades, for example, I don't do naked calls. \n\nUltimately, the people with the actual shares are ultimately the decision holders if they want to sell or not. An option is only a contract that at some point, needs some sort of actual stock tied to it. People could technically say I don't want to sell my stock and naked options traders would be screwed.","Presumably most of these are naked options, which are hedged up/down by MM based on the price/probability exposure. \n\nSo a bunch of calls raises their exposure. And they buy to hedge those calls. Which in turn, running into earnings will attract additional speculation and share buying, on top of the options. \n\nSo it creates the gamma squeeze as these calls all move closer to the money and have to have hedge buying to cover.  It becomes a feedback loop, which then immediately crashes as the calls are closed, thereby allowing them to dump their hedge since they no longer have to deliver those shares.","What you are saying could happen in one universe, maybe not in another.\n\nI personally wouldn't assume they are all, half, or even a quarter naked.

Build-a-bear has a unique advantage compared to most businesses in that the product it sells markets itself entirely, you go to build-a-bear to build yourself a stuffed animal and tell everyone else you built it and stuffed it yourself, rather then just simply buying a fucking stuffed bear. This gives it a unique position to capitalize on social media that the board just has not done yet, but have come to the realization of in the the nick of time. The brand alone is worth a billion dollars, this is a household name trading at microcap levels due to crystallized and stagnate valuations. This is essentially the greatest retail redemption arc ever told waiting to happen, and with JUST 15 million dollars could buy a controlling stake, including a bunch of autists pressuring the company to make frog plushies. Imagine if the shitty dress up games that 10 year old girls love to play asked them if they wanted to buy that doll in real life after they dressed it up, that is essentially the monetary minting machine waiting to be unearthed by build a bear  \n\n\nThey're turning more money then before covid, management has picked up on it being time to seriously turn the business model around. The brand value is mostly held in the 15-24yo consumer segment group who were children and interacted with the business every time they went to the mall, brand value which can now be tangentially turned around and spread through social media like wildfire by selling either sex or memes. Build-a-bear lets you bust-a-nut on valentines for example, or else switch to selling stuffed frogs and emojis or other random lulz shit and give people weird decoration options. It is a fundamnetally unique buisness model that deserves a unique valuation, the brand recognition on that business alone is insane and it's only 80 mil mcap.","Ban. No sub $1b mcap.

Waiting for weed stocks to calm the fuck down so I can reenter my long positions on APHY SNDL and TLRY\n\n2. Doing DD on A.MPE and ZOM and probably entering positions on those.","Long positions...on SNDL??","When they were 1.06 a share and cleared debt I thought they had a chance of being bought out since they have a good product","They are in the process of building a new 20 acre facility that's gonna serve the west coast; there is potential there. though the only thing i didn't sell off in cannabis was aurora. \n\nOGI is straight shit show though, it's the worst of the bunch. Most overvalued, least profits posted, and to boot they've been sued in the past for having really bad pesticides in their weed,same pesticide shit that has actually killed people stateside.","Well you holding Aurora and Aurora went through illegal growing,  firing up execs, overproducing and losing and selling their old crap, mmm did I mention the moldy episode and quality control problems ? \n\nNot defending ogi not even invested in it rn but what I mean is that shit hapens and what hapened to Aurora can (and will) hapen to others at some point. Doesnt make it necessarly a bad pick. I lost on Aurora and gained on cannopy but I almost feel i just shouldve invested and not looked until 5-10 years after. \n\nSo many growers, thriving market,  it will go through some better and darker times for many of them. Either its production issues , quality issues, bad management, buying from illegal growers on the side or other shaddy things or just having hard times with regulations... lot of things will hapen in this growth process of a fairly new industry. You can expect these to hapen even more in a bigger market with more players. Maybe exception of overproducing.  I think thats at least the good part of it, many will be able to have a run and from there the strongs will rise and the others may not but  may end up being bought as in the long terms every grower will needed to supply the increasing demand and using installations that are already in place just seems perfect. \n\nIn a long perspective  , since legalization here in Canada 28 months in and the legal vs illegal weed sales are estimated to have become even. With such a high demand there will be a lot of room for growth and many companies , even the ones wholl be going through dark times, can bounce back and become good long term investments.  Thats what Aurora teached me. Was a painful experience going through all this though. \n\nIm almost thinking of buying, set a reminder and not even look into it for years."," Aurora had it's issues, and it has gone through them and come out stronger in my opinion, which is exactly why i feel comfortable holding them. in regards to quality control problems, all im gonna say is, mold isn't intentional; pesticides are.","It did, when you look at the big picture. But would you have been as confident when they were in the middle of their dark era ?  Its easier to say afterwards. My point here is not to shit too fast on any of them in such a new and growing market. I did it with Aurora and time proved me wrong. Even stocks who have their dark days/weeks/months can make it through the storm. And while in the storm, its harder to see the light. \n\nAlso, im pretty sure growing illegaly is also intentional. Still, they are there.\n\nCant predict the future, and I dont know much about this pesticides thing in particular. It may be related to trying to save their asses after some bugs problems or you know, having some production issues. It doesnt mean its meant to die and that they cant bounce back. May just be part of the learning process.\n\nMy comment was more aiming all weed stocks than only about these two. I just used them as exemples because you mentionned both and I been going through it when Aurora had its loads of problems. Back then I felt it was going down and down and down and I was right , until I ended up being wrong.\n\nAnd with such a big growth in the next years, you can expect some rollercoasters. \n\nI just mean to look at them as long , long plays over a few years because meanwhile you can go through all the emotions in the world. I try not let my emotion and dips distract me on how many of these stocks will end up being good investments despite having to go through some shit in the process.","monday is gonna be red","Especially since the market will be closed","Might be flat idk tough to say","I'm betting flat","Could be up down or sideways but I’m pretty sure it’ll be flat","Big Green dildos tend to lead to a bloody mess","RIOT MOONING 🚀🚀","APHA back to $30 + next week, RIP to all the retards who bought puts lol","Don’t know about 30 but should go up with the merger.

So in the long run, I don’t see TSLA going up a lot unless Elon can pull something off soon.","NIO will never even be close to TSLA's Robotaxi and automated driving though that's the thing though. TSLA is already light years ahead of NIO in terms of driving data, will literally take NIO more than a decade to get the same data that TSLA has RIGHT NOW...and in 10 years TSLA will legit have just a stupid amount of data about 10,000 more than NIO. Not only that but NIO just cannot compete with TSLA in terms of robotaxi/automated driving, they'd have to partner up with NVDA to even come CLOSE to TSLA and even then they'd be three years behind TSLA and will have to pay extra money for NVDA's partnership which will decrease their margins or make the cars far more expensive while also not being on par with TSLA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no doubt in my mind that NIO is not a viable competitor to TSLA long term, and that if anything Ford is a bigger threat (And I don't even perceive F to be a threat) they are ridiculously far behind and it's literally impossible to pass up TSLA at this point","[removed]","This comment was removed because automod thinks it mentions a stock with a market cap below $1B.

The drug is a “game-changer,” said Dr. Robert F. Kushner, an obesity researcher at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, who led the study. “This is the start of a new era of effective treatments for obesity.”\n\nExpected to be the replacement for gastric bands etc.\n\n&gt;Dr. Caroline Apovian, co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and a member of Novo Nordisk’s advisory board, said the effectiveness of semaglutide was “phenomenal” and that the trial results may lead insurers to cover it.","They said the same things about orlistat, liraglutide, naloxone/buproprion, and phentermine/topiramate. IE, every other weight loss medication approved by the FDA.","Might be something to keep an eye on. \n\nThe medication is already FDA approved, so just waiting on permission for the increased dosages it seems.","For context, I'm a physician. I read the article on nejm. It's promising news and I will probably try using it in clinical practice but I don't think it's going to be a game changer that causes the stock to run up. Evidence shows it's more effective than liraglutide for weight loss, but to be honest there are so many issues with weight loss medications that have little to do with the effectiveness of the drug.","Thanks for your input and discussing it.  Will be keeping an eye on it for a few weeks and see how things look.  \n\nSeems it would be a lifetime medication, and the normal dose is like 1000 per month.  Either way, hope the insurance companies do cover it eventually as so many people's health and quality of lives would be improved.","That's the biggest issue, if they can make it much cheaper, it would change the world.

Damn you ain't give em ANY CHANCE🤣🤣","Hahaha it went down significantly then came back up again. My goal was to sell at a profit even at $1 🤣","A gain is a gain I guess..I think you should try again.. Even if it's with $100 in 5-10 shares. Wishing ya the best.","congrats blueboy, you have defeated 90% of this sub now by selling for a profit instead of holding until losing everything","Good to know!","Fuck today","SPY calls &amp; ON calls 🚀","Now this is pod racing","Hold SNDL to hopefully make some money back? Or cut my loses?","I’d personally cut my losses and move on. Unless you’re comfortable holding a bag for quite some time","Not advice but I would always cut my losses... like for any ticker","Is WSB or pennystocks faster to lose money?","Yesterday they were the same thing","Yep","Penny stocks are too degenerate even for me","Give a gorilla a thread, and you enrich him for a day\n\n𝘵𝘦𝘢𝘤𝘩 a gorilla to thread, and yoAEEE EEEE EEEE AAAAAH EEEEEH AAAAAH EAAAGHH EEEEGGGHHH","SNDL - After the mass sell off this morning it stablized at 1.90 - room for growth today\n\nI'm hoping so. and with the news of NASDAQ cert  will give it a push up.","The IV for GME is skyrocketing.\n\nSomething is gonna happen here, those Feb 26th 800c calls (hedges most likely) are coming due.\n\nI'm hoping for mooning of course (as a bagholder ROFL).\n\nIt appears the end of the GME drama is coming for good or Ill.","It’s not gonna be good. Don’t get your hopes up lol","Hope is for suckers at any rate.\n\nMy AMD and Disney are covering some of my GME losses.\n\nI don't bet on hope  or hype very often....a lesson reinforced with GME bagholding lol","The hearing next week in DC is not gonna be good. For certain players for sure. LOL","RIOT $25 by Tuesday","Bro, we need a support group at this point, because the pump is starting to leave this earth...","I watched TLRY soar after hours over $10 past the strike price on my puts the other day and ended up winning the next day. I’m trying to keep that energy.","That worked well, I’ll try to calm down a bit. But man, this WSB fueled frenzy of smooth brains putting their dollars into calls that are already up many times this week are causing idiotic instability in the market.","I’ve actually liked RIOT as a stock for months so I’ve expected it to rise along with Elon’s favorite coin but this recent pump is just so unnatural. Seeing the stock recently become more popular in the daily thread  probably isn’t a coincidence.","I would love to hear the rationale for liking it. I’ve read their financial statements and it seems like they’re structurally unprofitable due to them buying their rigs which depreciate sooner that they recoup the investment. And they don’t even hold binary currency on their balance sheet. Also, only $6 mil in revenue last 9 months...","Compared to eloncoin it’s just been a better returning investment. I was planning on holding until before March earnings but this current pump and dump probably killed that idea. I’m not really sure how mining companies stay profitable tbh. It just seems like a better idea to go ahead and buy the coin than mine it. I first saw this stock at $1 and I’ve always came back to it after losing all my money on other stupid plays lol.","GME short interest ~80% &gt;&gt;&gt; weed stocks","BA ✈️ 🌚","#🛬💥","Shoutout to my dudes who bought in to SPWR last month","IMGN CALLS BEFORE CLOSE","Really no GME thread?","Gme is dead your a bag holder .

Very cool. Very legal","PSTH is bubbling.","Wtf is wrong with Canopy, just follow Tilray and burn you fuk","It’s actually a legit company unlike all those others","NOK UP 2%!!!! Well I guess in 5 years it may breach $5.","I can't help but think about today exp TWTR put tendies, should I go full retard and get in","[removed]","This comment was removed because automod thinks it mentions a stock with a market cap below $1B.
